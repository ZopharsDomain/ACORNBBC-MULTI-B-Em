B-em v1.5
=========

Source for the DOS, Windows and OS X versions are included. The DOS
version should/may also compile under Linux/QNX/BeOS, although I haven't
tried this. The Windows and OS X versions use a lot of platform-specific code, 
and will not compile on other platforms.

The OS X source is of version v1.0, DOS is v1.1, and Windows is v1.4a.

The DOS and Windows versions will not compile under GCC 4 as I have this bad
habit of declaring variables in multiple source files instead of using header
files properly. The OS X version has been corrected and does compile. For v1.0
I tried to correct this, at least in the DOS port.

The DOS and OSX ports require fdi2raw.c and fdi2raw.h from WinUAE. These are not 
included anymore due to licensing problems.

For the DOS version, you will need :
DJGPP   
Allegro 
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the Windows version, you will need :
Ming/W
Allegro 
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the OS X version you need :
Xcode
Allegro
Zlib

Just compile and link all the C files with the above libraries.
